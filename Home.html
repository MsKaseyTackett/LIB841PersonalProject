    <p>We often find that the path that we have chosen in the early portion of our careers doesn't always reflect who we are during the veteran stages. 
	This website will provide resources, encouragement, and inspirational stories of a middle-aged woman who, in the prime of her career, decided to make 
	a change.</p>
    <p>At the risk of severely aging myself, I graduated college in 2004 with a degree in Education with an emphasis in grades 5-9. My first teaching 
	position consisted of teaching the subject of Reading to 5th and 6th grade students. Although I loved working in the field of 
	education, I knew that long-term confinement to one classroom all day was not in my career plans so the process of "what else do I want to be" began.</p>
    <p>I lovingly refer to this next part of my life as the <i>metaphorical coin flip that determined my path.</i> Although I <strong>knew</strong> that 
	my path needed to be based on not only my needs but students' as well. Ultimately, this led me to School Guidance Counselor or Librarian, 
	which at that time, was offered at two different universities. So I applied to both and <b>waited...</b><br>Morehead State University's 
	<em>School Counselor Program</em> for the win! For those that are interested in pursuing the field of School Counseling, follow 
	the link below to their website. <a href="https://www.moreheadstate.edu/academics/programs/counseling-ma/a">Morehead State University's 
	School Counselor Program.</a></p>
	<p> As I followed my chosen path for the next fifteen years, I gained valuable experience and developed not only a significant skill base, but established
	a plethora of resources that proved to be universal in their applications. I truly understand when people say, "I could write a book" when referring to 
	their career experiences as I genuinely feel as if I could do the same. I experienced a lot of laughter, frustration, tears, and was often humbled by my 
	own misconceptions or actions. Although I felt like I had a sincere sense of empathy, every day proved I had more to learn. The ebb and flow of being a 
	School Guidance Counselor comes with challenges and rewards, but ultimately, the rate of becoming burned out is high. So, with maturity and self-reflection, I 
	decided to make a change. Although I write that with ease, I assure you the decision was anything but easy. This decision would require leaving my safety net of 
	the county in which I was well-established and had roots to venture to a foreign county that had current job opportunities. I was willing to drive if the position
	fit my career goals and I was also willing to return to school to pursue my goals. With fierce determination, I set out to make it happen. But, how?
<p>The answer didn't come to me as if in a movie when the lightbulb appears over the character's head, a proverbial "a-ha" so to speak, but rather after
some extensive research regarding universities that housed the program, entrance requirements, and the required timeframe to meet those requirements. I contacted 
multiple universities, spoke with program directors, and ultimately, the one that fit my needs was Eastern Kentucky University. Once I established that this is 
where I was going to "hang my hat", I began the extensive process of fulfilling the requirements to be considered for admittance into the proficiency evaluation
program which would allow me to hold the position of Library Media Specialist while simultaneously taking courses. After taking the Praxis and receiving a passing score, 
then submitting my portfolio, I awaited the results. When the confirmation that I had indeed been accepted into the program came, I was elated and knew that my journey was 
just beginning. </p>
<p> Although I am thankful for the hurdles I overcame during my intial steps in this transition, I also know that it is sometimes an insurmountable 
task for those that have busy lives. That is why I created this website: with the hope that those who are dreaming of a change aren't deterred or feel
like a lost ball in high weeds. Utilize the links, contact me with any unanswered questions, and stay the course. Anything worth dreaming about is certainly
worth working for...
